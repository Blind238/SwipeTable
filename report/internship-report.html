<p>The use case was the starting point for the assignment. From the use case I was able to determine the requirements, personas and scenarios. What follows is the use case verbatim.</p>
<p><strong>Use case data grid plugin</strong>
It&#39;s important for many automatisation applications to oversee large amounts of datasets.</p>
<p>At Lunatech we create such applications for a number of our customers. However, the usage of such data grids tends to only run on the desktop. In fact, it is usually recommended to use a powerful desktop.</p>
<p>One of our logistics customers uses shipping data from within the warehouse and therefore need a desktop setup on site. It would be preferable to use a tablet to be able to access this data as portability would be a huge asset. Memory and CPU constraints make this a non-viable option.</p>
<p>To make a light weight web front-end we need to know how to serve and render the data in way that will work on Post-PC devices. How small can we go?</p>
<h1 class="docs-heading">3. Project<a href="#3-project" name="3-project" class="anchor">

<p><code>With short description, my part of it, my process and the choices I’ve made, and ‘verantwoording competenties’.</code></p>
<p>There was a lot of freedom involved in the main project. This meant that I had to be very careful about the steps I took and the decisions I made.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">3.1. Preliminary Research<a href="#3-1-preliminary-research" name="3-1-preliminary-research" class="anchor">

</h2>
<p>The first few days I did as much research as I could so I could discuss things with my supervisor, Egor Kloos. He would be on vacation for 2 weeks after that.</p>
<p>The preliminary research was not focused on requirements, instead I wanted to explore what was already out there and what could be possible. I also tried to deduce any issues I may encounter during the project.</p>
<p>I also started a log of progress during the research, documenting observations.</p>

</h1>
<p>To build the project, I used several tools. They helped in building the base that the project was built on. They helped in development by checking for errors and reloading the browser on each save. They helped by combining the different parts into a few distributable files.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">6.1 Yeoman<a href="#6-1-yeoman" name="6-1-yeoman" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="6-1-yeoman"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p>The basis for the project was done with Yeoman and generator-lib, a JavaScript library generator built for Yeoman. Yeoman is a utility that helps with all the boilerplate that usually comes with projects. After trying out generator-lib, I decided to use it. It came with useful grunt tasks I could build upon and a sane project folder structure. It also built out a simple demo page and a readme.md.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">6.2. Grunt<a href="#6-2-grunt" name="6-2-grunt" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="6-2-grunt"></span>

</a>
</h2>
<p>Grunt is a command line tool to execute tasks. It is built on top of node.js and uses JavaScript syntax for it&#39;s tasks. It is fully configurable and has a lot of plugins for a lot of tasks.</p>
<p>A list of the plugins I&#39;ve used:</p>
<ul>
<li>grunt</li>
<li><p>load-grunt-tasks</p>
</li>
<li><p>grunt-contrib-concat</p>

<li>grunt-contrib-jshint</li>

<li>grunt-contrib-connect</li>
<li><p>connect-livereload</p>
