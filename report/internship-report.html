<p>This is a report on my internship at Lunatech. The internship began in early September and ran for 6 months. The product of the internship was SwipeTable, a JavaScript library focused on mobile table viewing and navigation.</p>
<p>When looking for internship assignments, my search was not aimed at the competencies I had to prove to be proficient in. Instead I looked for interesting opportunities and developed my goals afterwards.</p>
<p>When I applied for information from Lunatech, I also asked at 4 other companies for information and possible positions. Some responded with information, some didn&#39;t have an open spot anymore, but Lunatech were interested and wanted to meet.</p>
<p>At Lunatech i was interviewed by Egor Kloos, who would also be my supervisor for the internship. The interview went well and next thing you know we&#39;re planning the assignment, getting contracts signed, etc.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">1.1. Goals<a href="#1-1-goals" name="1-1-goals" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="1-1-goals"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p>These are the goals I started out with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn other ways to structure a program, such as Prototypal Inheritance, functional programming and various design patterns.</li>
<li>To understand and be able to properly use JavaScript. I think it’s a very important element in our field for the next couple of years.</li>
<li>To be able to judge how far I can go with the plugin after a few weeks of the internship. Also to be able to assess if I can go further, either by expanding the assignment or adding other smaller assignments.</li>
<li>I want the internship to be kind of a second test, to see if I can still apply the skills and techniques I’ve learned. These can be technical skills like applying design patterns and also non-technical, like writing an advisory and a test plan.</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>The company where I ran my internship was Lunatech. Lunatech started out as a research company and transitioned over the years to a consulting and services company. One of their primary clients is UPC, for whom they handle some of the information flow for shipments.</p>
<p>At Lunatech my supervisor was the only front end developer. The rest were mostly developers, either back end or working on features to implement. Developers that were on the floor I was on, did know about some front end stuff because they worked more on implementing interfaces. However, they were still more on the technical side, from my observations.</p>

<p>Below is the original assignment:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;# Intern assignment FRONT-END | LUNATECH

&gt;The intern will perform the tasks of a front-end developer and acquire the skills and knowledge needed for this and other related positions (i.e. web developer).

&gt;The intern will focus on:

&gt;1. Javascript (optionally with: coffeescript, dart, etc)
2. Integrating UI and backend and dealing with UX issues.
3. CMS and online tooling. (content and server related dashboards)
4. Assisting on running (mobile) web projects.

&gt;Lunatech will provide assistance and support so that the intern can have a functional deliverable of a personal project to demonstrate.

&gt;## Assignment: A new type of data grid.

&gt;At the end of the assignment there should at least be a full first version of a open sourced script on Github.

&gt;### Unique selling points

&gt;1. **Small memory footprint**
2. Prototypal inheritance (see point 1)
3. Stand alone script. (No jQuery or Bootstrap, see point 1)
4. Modern browsers. (including mobile webkit, see point 1)
5. High performance (see point 1).

&gt;#### Tasks

&gt;* Research the type of construction required to get high performance and or easy maintenance.
* Prototypes (Paper, Keynote/Powerpoint, HTML)
* Set up integrated mockup on a web server / database.
** [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com)
** [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com)
** MAMP, Playframework / Tomcat
** MySql, NoSql, Postgress, MongoDB etc.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Pick a licence (MIT, Apache, GPL ?)</li>
</ul>
<p>While this was originally the plan, things have changed during the course of the project. Due to the amount of time spent on the JavaScript Data Grid Plugin, some tasks didn&#39;t get any attention. This wasn&#39;t an issue though because from early on the focus was on the JavaScript side. The other tasks were possible things I could be working on because I was worried the main assignment wouldn&#39;t be enough. I was wrong.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">2.2 Use Case<a href="#2-2-use-case" name="2-2-use-case" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="2-2-use-case"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p>The use case was the starting point for the assignment. From the use case I was able to determine the requirements, personas and scenarios. What follows is the use case verbatim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use case data grid plugin</strong>
It&#39;s important for many automatisation applications to oversee large amounts of datasets.</p>
<p>At Lunatech we create such applications for a number of our customers. However, the usage of such data grids tends to only run on the desktop. In fact, it is usually recommended to use a powerful desktop.</p>
<p>One of our logistics customers uses shipping data from within the warehouse and therefore need a desktop setup on site. It would be preferable to use a tablet to be able to access this data as portability would be a huge asset. Memory and CPU constraints make this a non-viable option.</p>
<p>To make a light weight web front-end we need to know how to serve and render the data in way that will work on Post-PC devices. How small can we go?</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 class="docs-heading">3. Project<a href="#3-project" name="3-project" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="3-project"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h1>
<p><code>With short description, my part of it, my process and the choices I’ve made, and ‘verantwoording competenties’.</code></p>
<p>There was a lot of freedom involved in the  project. This meant that I had to be very careful about the steps I took and the decisions I made. </p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">3.1. Preliminary Research<a href="#3-1-preliminary-research" name="3-1-preliminary-research" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="3-1-preliminary-research"></span>

</a>
</h2>
<p>The first few days I did as much research as I could so I could discuss things with my supervisor, Egor Kloos. He would be on vacation for 2 weeks after that.</p>
<p>The preliminary research was not focused on requirements, instead I wanted to explore what was already out there and what could be possible. I also tried to deduce any issues I may encounter during the project.</p>
<p>I also started a log of progress during the research, documenting observations. I found that the log was useful within a week of each entry, sometimes 2 weeks.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">3.2 Development<a href="#3-2-development" name="3-2-development" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="3-2-development"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p>Once the research was done I started studying JavaScript. I didn&#39;t know enough so I went and looked for resources. I spent a lot of time reading articles by Douglas Crockford and watched about 5 hours of him talking about JavaScript. I think he&#39;s a great source of information but a bit too opinionated. I would consider it a great start to JavaScript knowledge but I&#39;d advise to look at other sources after that. I didn&#39;t keep track of other authors I&#39;ve read after that because I was too busy prototyping.</p>
<p>When making my first prototype I started with CoffeeScript as it looked simpler to understand. However, I find that it did too much under the hood and I couldn&#39;t understand why it did some of the things it did. When compiling back to JavaScript it would abstract functions and variables and it becomes hard to debug. So because I didn&#39;t have enough knowledge then, I decided to just stick to plain JavaScript.</p>
<p>During actual development it was mostly me researching for the next feature, discuss with my supervisor, program feature, and testing for performance and usability real quick. That&#39;s oversimplifying it of course, different features require differing approaches. This went on until the end of the project.</p>

</h2>
<p>SwipeTable required an API server so it could be tested and demonstrated. Initially I tried hosting the server at my home computer but I couldn&#39;t get remote development working properly. I then did some looking around and tried out Amazon EC2 virtual servers. I could run a tiny virtual server for free while being able to work remotely.</p>
<p>The way the server gets updated is pretty simple, although it takes a little bit of setup. The server is a node.js server, running on nodemon. Nodemon is a node.js program that restarts a server based on file changes. The way I made the files change was to use Dropbox on the server. All of the server files are in a Dropbox folder, so when I make a change while at Lunatech and save it, the file gets changed on the Amazon server via Dropbox. This allowed for a very quick development workflow. </p>

</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student can objectively describe the target audience based on research. The student knows which methods and techniques to use to come to concrete user needs.<br>The student is capable of actively listening during interviews and has a neutral position in reports. The student is capable of defining user tasks,  can describe functionality with other developers with a focus on usability, and can categorize the functionalities in differing groups.<br>The student can fit the user needs within the interface possibilities of the media product.<br>The student is capable of testing interface proposals at the different stages of the development process and can select the right method to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>I decided early on that the project should have a focus on Usability and User Experience. I would discuss my ideas on the Usability of the project with my supervisor on an almost weekly basis. Topics discussed included: getting the attention of the user, showing the user what could be done, different ways to present functionality.</p>
<p>During the project I couldn&#39;t test on the intended users because they would be in France (the case was based on a client of Lunatech). Distance shouldn&#39;t be a problem but the language barrier and the fact that it was in a production environment made it difficult to test anything. So instead I opted to periodically discuss possible issues with my supervisor.</p>
<p>Figuring out what the possible issues could be, required occasional research into usability problems with data grids(tables) and smaller interactable viewports. Example: How do you show many columns to the user in a readable way?</p>
<p><strong>Room for improvement</strong><br>While doing the research I didn&#39;t cite any sources. I would read the article, blog or paper and then make notes on what is applicable to the project. Now that I&#39;m writing this report I miss the sources of information. Another drawback is that I can&#39;t review the sources again. My perspective now is different than when I wrote the notes, I would like to verify if the source data is still applicable.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">4.2. Usability Engineering<a href="#4-2-usability-engineering" name="4-2-usability-engineering" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="4-2-usability-engineering"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student is capable of prioritizing the user of the finished product during the development process. This starts with the user, from which requirements are distilled and used as input for the design and production process. There&#39;s feedback during the whole process and the student tests whether the needs of the user are met.<br>The student is capable of thinking outside the actual product about usability aspects, in the form of installation, configuration and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>Usability Engineering is a bit difficult to quantify. There is some overlap between Usability Engineering, Usability Research and Analysis. I&#39;ll just focus on what doesn&#39;t overlap: the testing.</p>
<p>SwipeTable was tested mostly on a 1 on 1 basis and in an informal way. I would show a colleague or a friend the table and observe their interaction and reaction to the product. I just let them go at it without any explanation and if they asked about anything, I clarified a bit.</p>
<p>Afterwards I would ask them about things that I noticed. From the feedback I would then try to deduce why the behavior wasn&#39;t as expected and adjusted accordingly, or discuss with my supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Room for improvement</strong><br>I really felt the need to test at every opportunity. For my next project I would like to test whenever possible. I believe that frequently testing the product on user and getting the feedback from them is one of the most important things you can do. In the end the product has to meet the user&#39;s needs from a usability standpoint. If a product is functional but confusing and unusable, it is worthless.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">4.3. Analysis<a href="#4-3-analysis" name="4-3-analysis" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="4-3-analysis"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student knows how to apply professional tools to get to a high quality analysis. The student can analyze ict subsystems and can describe relationships between systems, while taking into account people, means and possibilities.<br>The student has insight of the context in which the product is effective.<br>The student is capable of putting together a requirements package based on a complex situation sketch. The student can perform a business process analysis and describe the workflow within a company. The student is capable of doing both qualitative and quantitative research of the process.<br>The student can represent an analysis in diagrams and overviews, while keeping the experiential world of the audience in mind during feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>I made a couple of persona&#39;s and scenario&#39;s representing the case to help with understanding the user. The first persona made was a representation of a worker in a warehouse. This persona is who the product is made for. The second persona made was a representation of an average person. This persona was made to explore possible uses outside of the case.</p>
<p>Two scenario&#39;s were made based on the warehouse worker persona. Both take place in the warehouse. One was made to represent casual use of a previous system, while another for more frequent use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Personas</strong><br>Primary Persona<br>Thomas Anneijes<br>Thomas is 34 years old. He works at a shipping company in the warehouse, managing the shipments. He is married and has 2 children. He is kind of a perfectionist. He does not like frog legs, even though it is considered one of his country&#39;s delicacies.</p>
<p>Secondary Persona<br>Elise Van Laren<br>Elise is 27 years old. She works at a cultural center, organizing events such as festivals, concerts and exhibitions. She is outgoing  She has a boyfriend, who she met at one of the concerts. She does like frog legs, but only deep fried.</p>
<p><strong>Scenarios</strong><br>Thomas is at work, and he just finished his lunch. After helping some workers with a couple of shipment issues, he needs to go check the shipping logs. The shipping logs can only be viewed at the computer that&#39;s been set up near the entrance of the warehouse, right next to a small office. Right now Thomas is at the other side of the warehouse though, so he needs to walk all the way there to check the logs. He checks the logs and is done in some seconds, he only needed to see what&#39;s new and what is about to leave the system. After he&#39;s checked the logs he goes back to the opposite site of the warehouse, where he&#39;s been called to help again.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the start of the workday and Thomas needed to do some paperwork in the office real quick. Basically forms for hour registration and assigning his vacation days, which he&#39;s put off doing for too long. Once he&#39;s done at the office he goes to the computer just outside the office to check the shipping logs of the previous day and today. That computer is there only so the workers can easily see the logs, so the logging application is always open on it. After checking the logs for any inconsistencies, he goes to check the shipments that have come in the night before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve also looked at the flow of information during different phases of development. See Appendix 4.3 for diagrams.</p>
<p><strong>Room for improvement</strong><br>While doing the research I didn&#39;t cite any sources. I would read the article, blog or paper and then make notes on what is applicable to the project. Now that I&#39;m writing this report I miss the sources of information. Another drawback is that I can&#39;t review the sources again. My perspective now is different than when I wrote the notes, I would like to verify if the source data is still applicable.</p>
<p>I also didn&#39;t make an analysis of the system beforehand. I would mostly do it while I&#39;m already busy with the thing I want to do. If I had analyzed it and not just researched it, I feel that I could have prevented some problems with the flow of information in the library.</p>

  <span class="anchor-target" id="4-4-advice"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student can give advice based on limited client meetings, where the student is capable of clarifying the necessary aspects for a clear advice. The advice is aimed towards technical problems(choosing between technical solutions and communicating this clearly from the target audience&#39;s experience). The student makes use of knowledge about the most common development environments / frameworks / programming languages, with the strengths and weaknesses of each.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>I researched data grid(table) representation on mobile devices and existing solutions to the problem. This research was used to make an Advisory, which is attached to this document. See Appendix 4.4 for the Advisory</p>
<p>Early in the development process I also had to choose which programming language or framework I was going to use to make the plugin. The thing is, I wasn&#39;t that good in JavaScript so I started with the simpler looking CoffeeScript, which compiles into JavaScript. I made a small program to figure out CoffeeScript and what the resulting JavaScript code looked like. There were too many abstractions being made in the translation from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. There were optimizations happening that I didn&#39;t understand due to my inexperience with JavaScript. I therefor decided to not use any framework or other language than pure JavaScript. Another language I did briefly look at was Dart, but it was not similar to JavaScript. One of my bigger goals was to learn JavaScript so Dart was not an option.</p>
<p><strong>Room for improvement</strong><br>While working on the advisory, I did not take into account the financial aspects of the analysis. While there wasn&#39;t a financial analysis, I could have still made a rough estimation of time saved based on warehouse size, distance walked and time spent looking for information of the user(in particular the primary persona).</p>
<p>Going forward I will look at CoffeeScript and Dart again, as I now have a good understanding of JavaScript.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">4.5. Interaction/Interface Design<a href="#4-5-interaction-interface-design" name="4-5-interaction-interface-design" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="4-5-interaction-interface-design"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student is capable of setting up the design of a media and/or software product, based on the given specifications and in relation to an advisory and analysis report.<br>The interaction/interface design contains a complete description of the specifications from the analysis phase.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>From the preliminary research I figured out how the interaction should feel like. The idea was to make it easy and if possible intuitive to use the plugin. I made some wireframes to show the intended interactions, which is attached.</p>
<p>The design changed as development went on to account for user behavior and expectations. The basic navigation stayed the same while details on the buttons and header were added to encourage interaction.</p>
<p>Interesting thing that I&#39;ve noticed is that people tend to want to scroll vertically instead of horizontally. To counteract this I gave horizontal feedback to vertical scrolling, thus encouraging desired behavior.</p>

  <span class="anchor-target" id="4-6-technical-design"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student can apply multiple design methods and techniques in the design of a media and/or software product. The student is capable of describing interfaces between systems and be able to differentiate between functional, non-functional and technical requirements. The design and the accompanying principles that were established are documented in a Design Document.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>In this project I did all of the programming. While I did have to relay some technical decisions to my supervisor, I didn&#39;t have to make a Design Document for this project. I did however have to document some aspects of the design for own use so I could have a good grasp on what I was doing.</p>
<p>The flow of information in the program was sketched out because I needed to figure out a way to solve a problem. The problem had to do with the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and how to pass information between parts of the program. </p>

<h2 class="docs-heading">4.7. Production<a href="#4-7-production" name="4-7-production" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="4-7-production"></span>
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student can apply diverse development environments / frameworks / programming languages, particularly the syntax, library contents, applicable design patterns and best practices for the chosen environment.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>When I started having problems with the asynchronous aspects of JavaScript and coordinating 3 different parts, I looked for a solution. I came upon the concept of promises. I researched different promise libraries focusing on size and performance. After doing a couple of experiments and studying recent benchmarks I decided to use the &#39;when&#39; library. After struggling a bit with implementing promises, I successfully replaced asynchronous calls with promises and fixed the issues I was having before. Promises also made the flow of information clearer and helped to keep SwipeTable understandable.</p>
<p>At first I used the Swipe library for it&#39;s smoothly animating panels. Swipe&#39;s implementation had great performance and had a pretty small footprint. I could use it&#39;s callbacks for my needs and things were working alright. When I tried to optimize the whole package I noticed that I could get more out of Swipe by having it inside SwipeTable. Swipe was then internalized and some functionality was taken outside of it&#39;s scope to be used by other parts of SwipeTable. The translate function was used for moving the header area.</p>
<p>Using Grunt and the bootstrapping done by Yeoman has really helped the production workflow. I could easily look at changes and get notified of possible JavaScript errors while developing.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student can perform acceptance tests on a product and has knowledge of important factors that are involved. The test is performed against the following standards: correctness, completeness, usability, package of requirements, delivery according to an implementation plan.<br>The student can judge a product at delivery whether it passes general quality standards.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>As was planned, I delivered a working product with clear instructions on how to contribute, according to current Github best practices. </p>
<p><strong>Room for improvement</strong><br>There were no formal acceptance tests done on SwipeTable.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong><br>The student is a team player that functions well in a multi disciplinary team, and is a positive addition to the team spirit. The student is open for other ideas or angles from other team members, and handles feedback in a constructive manner, both in receiving feedback and giving it. The student also recognizes their own qualities and those of others, and knows how to utilize them.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong><br>I&#39;m usually not that great with criticism and take it too harshly. For this project I feel that I take critique much better than before. I think it has to do with the way I approached the feedback. I would try not to take it personally and would note it in my log when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Room for improvement</strong><br>In this project there wasn&#39;t really a team to work with. While I could approach my supervisor and other colleagues with questions, I was still the one doing all the work. </p>

<p>To build the project, I used several tools. They helped in building the base that the project was built on. They helped in development by checking for errors and reloading the browser on each save. They helped by combining the different parts into a few distributable files.</p>

<p>The basis for the project was generated with Yeoman and generator-lib, a JavaScript library generator built for Yeoman. Yeoman is a utility that helps with all the boilerplate that usually comes with projects. After trying out generator-lib, I decided to use it. It came with useful grunt tasks I could build upon and a sane project folder structure. It also built out a simple demo page and a readme file.</p>

<p><strong>Use case data grid plugin</strong><br>It&#39;s important for many automatisation applications to oversee large amounts of datasets.</p>
<p>At Lunatech we create such applications for a number of our customers. However, the usage of such data grids tends to only run on the desktop. In fact, it is usually recommended to use a powerful desktop.</p>
<p>One of our logistics customers uses shipping data from within the warehouse and therefore need a desktop setup on site. It would be preferable to use a tablet to be able to access this data as portability would be a huge asset. Memory and CPU constraints make this a non-viable option.</p>
<p>To make a light weight web front-end we need to know how to serve and render the data in way that will work on Post-PC devices. How small can we go?</p>

<p>To get a better picture of what the case requires, we are going to look at factors affecting performance and mobile user experience. Advice will then be given based on the more suitable options available. Since the case is focused on mobile performance, the factors that can affect performance must be researched. The representation of data is also important since we are dealing with a smaller screen and most tools cover desktop usage. Topics that are covered: Performance, Mobile User Experience.</p>
<h2 class="docs-heading">Performance<a href="#performance" name="performance" class="anchor">
  <span class="anchor-target" id="performance"></span>

</h2>
<p>There are different aspects of performance that are applicable in this case. Aspects that we can&#39;t control are the browser’s rendering performance and the performance of the device’s network environment. We&#39;ll be focusing on the areas that can be under our control.</p>
<p>A big part of the performance is what the plugin actually tries to do. The plugin can load all the data or only part of it. The plugin can sort the data or let the data source(back-end server) sort it. The plugin can keep the data it receives for further use or fetch data from the data source on each action. All of these actions and behaviors affect the performance of the plugin in a positive or negative way. Basically, the less the plugin has to do, the more performant it is.</p>
<p>Options to increase the performance of the plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the data source handle sorting</li>
<li>Retrieve the data in parts instead of a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>Options to increase the performance of the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use helper libraries such as jQuery</li>
<li>Keep as little data in memory as possible</li>
<li>Prevent DOM reflows and repaints where possible</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as available plugins go, none that have been found are mobile oriented. The provided plugin demos have been tested on a Nexus 4 using stable Chrome browser. Simple tables performed well but were hard to navigate. SlickGrid&#39;s scrolling table performed terribly on mobile, on desktop it had great performance. They typically have a (configurable) large feature set.</p>
<p>Notable researched JavaScript table plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>DataTables</li>
<li>jTable</li>
<li>SlickGrid</li>
</ul>

<p>Interfaces on mobile devices have different environments than on desktops, where tabular data is typically viewed. The available display size determines(to a point) how much data/information you can present to the user. The amount of columns that can be displayed is further limited by the orientation of the display.</p>
<p>There are plugins which only deal with presenting a table for a portable device. Most of these plugins are built for jQuery. Those that don&#39;t tend to use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to present the table.</p>
<p>The blog post Responsive Data Table Roundup(January 11 2012, Chris Coyier) consolidated different methods on adapting the layout of a table to smaller displays. I agree with arguments in the post so I won&#39;t be restating them here. A copy is provided in the appendix.</p>

<p>For the sake of performance the plugin should be as lightweight as possible. The plugin should only handle part of the data in the form of pages. The representation can be via pagination or a continuous list, but testing with SlickGrid shows that a continuous list might not be the best choice. Consider that the data will have to be fetched, manipulated and displayed extremely fast for the list not to have gaps.</p>
<p>The case does not mention editing the data so until clarified assume a read-only scenario.</p>
<p>The case does not discuss the form that the data should be represented. It doesn&#39;t mention if columns or a subset of the data can be omitted. If all of the data needs to be accessible, Zurb&#39;s Responsive Tables seems the most viable. All of the data will be viewable and the user can still compare items. If touch is used, it also seems more intuitive to scroll by touching the scrollable element of the table.</p>
<p>An alternative is David Bushell&#39;s method, although it is not that intuitive. It will need to be tested to see if it is actually viable.</p>

</h2>
<p>As the case doesn&#39;t mention accessibility, it wasn&#39;t explicitly researched. Do keep in mind that some manner of accessibility is inherent in any interface, we are dealing with humans after all.</p>
<p>Security also wasn&#39;t mentioned by the case. Because the product is a plugin, we can assume that the plugin&#39;s environment will be secure enough for the use of the plugin. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the plugin&#39;s responsiblity to be secure, only to display the data.</p>
