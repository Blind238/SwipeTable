# 6. Tools
To build the project, I used several tools. They helped in building the base that the project was built on. They helped in development by checking for errors and reloading the browser on each save. They helped by combining the different parts into a few distributable files.

## 6.1 Yeoman
The basis for the project was done with Yeoman and generator-lib, a JavaScript library generator built for Yeoman. Yeoman is a utility that helps with all the boilerplate that usually comes with projects. After trying out generator-lib, I decided to use it. It came with useful grunt tasks I could build upon and a sane project folder structure. It also built out a simple demo page and a readme.md.

## 6.2. Grunt
Grunt is a command line tool to execute tasks. It is built on top of node.js and uses JavaScript syntax for it's tasks. It is fully configurable and has a lot of plugins for a lot of tasks.

A list of the plugins I've used:

* grunt
* load-grunt-tasks

* grunt-contrib-concat
* grunt-contrib-jshint
* grunt-contrib-qunit
* grunt-contrib-uglify

* grunt-contrib-sass
* grunt-autoprefixer
* grunt-contrib-cssmin

* grunt-contrib-watch
* grunt-contrib-connect
* connect-livereload

* browserify
* grunt-browserify
* deamdify
* debowerify
