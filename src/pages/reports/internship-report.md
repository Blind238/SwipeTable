`Why I chose my goals and internship location.`

# 2. The Assignment
`Insert`
## 2.1 Use Case
The use case was the starting point for the assignment. From the use case I was able to determine the requirements, personas and scenarios. What follows is the use case verbatim.

**Use case data grid plugin**
It's important for many automatisation applications to oversee large amounts of datasets.

At Lunatech we create such applications for a number of our customers. However, the usage of such data grids tends to only run on the desktop. In fact, it is usually recommended to use a powerful desktop.

One of our logistics customers uses shipping data from within the warehouse and therefore need a desktop setup on site. It would be preferable to use a tablet to be able to access this data as portability would be a huge asset. Memory and CPU constraints make this a non-viable option.

To make a light weight web front-end we need to know how to serve and render the data in way that will work on Post-PC devices. How small can we go?

# 3. Project
`With short description, my part of it, my process and the choices I’ve made, and ‘verantwoording competenties’.`

There was a lot of freedom involved in the main project. This meant that I had to be very careful about the steps I took and the decisions I made.

## 3.1. Preliminary Research
The first few days I did as much research as I could so I could discuss things with my supervisor, Egor Kloos. He would be on vacation for 2 weeks after that.

The preliminary research was not focused on requirements, instead I wanted to explore what was already out there and what could be possible. I also tried to deduce any issues I may encounter during the project.

I also started a log of progress during the research, documenting observations.

# 4. Specific Competencies

## 4.1. Usability Research
**Description**  
The student can objectively describe the target audience based on a research(FIX). De student knows which methods and techniques to use to come to concrete user needs.  
The student is capable of actively listening during interviews and has a neutral position in reports. The student is capable of defining user tasks,  can describe functionality with other developers with a focus on usability, and can categorize the functionalities in differing groups.  
The student can fit the user needs within the interface possibilities of the media product.  
The student is capable of testing interface proposals at the different stages of the development process and can select the right method to do so.

## 4.2. Usability Engineering
**Description**  
The student is capable of prioritizing the user of the finished product during the development process. This starts with the user, from which requirements are distilled and used as input for the design and production process. There's feedback during the whole process and the student tests whether the needs of the user are met.  
The student is capable of thinking outside the actual product about usability aspects, in the form of installation, configuration and maintenance.

## 4.3. Analysis
**Description**  
The student knows how to apply professional tools to get to a high quality analysis. The student can analyze ict subsystems and can describe relationships between systems, while taking into account people, means and possibilities.  
The student has insight of the context in which the product is effective.  
The student is capable of putting together a requirements package based on a complex situation sketch. The student can perform a business process analysis and describe the workflow within a company. The student is capable of doing both qualitative and quantitative research of the process.  
`De student kan een analyse modelleren in diagrammen en overzichten en houdt bij terugkoppeling rekening met de belevingswereld van het publiek (translate later).`

## 4.4. Advice
**Description**  
The student can give advice based on limited client meetings, where the student is capable of clarifying the necessary aspects for a clear advice. The advice is aimed towards technical problems(choosing between technical solutions and communicating this clearly from the target audience's experience). The student makes use of knowledge about the most common development environments / frameworks / programming languages, with the strengths and weaknesses of each.

# 6. Tools
To build the project, I used several tools. They helped in building the base that the project was built on. They helped in development by checking for errors and reloading the browser on each save. They helped by combining the different parts into a few distributable files.

## 6.1 Yeoman
The basis for the project was done with Yeoman and generator-lib, a JavaScript library generator built for Yeoman. Yeoman is a utility that helps with all the boilerplate that usually comes with projects. After trying out generator-lib, I decided to use it. It came with useful grunt tasks I could build upon and a sane project folder structure. It also built out a simple demo page and a readme.md.

## 6.2. Grunt
Grunt is a command line tool to execute tasks. It is built on top of node.js and uses JavaScript syntax for it's tasks. It is fully configurable and has a lot of plugins for a lot of tasks.

A list of the plugins I've used:

* grunt
* load-grunt-tasks

* grunt-contrib-concat
* grunt-contrib-jshint
* grunt-contrib-qunit
* grunt-contrib-uglify

* grunt-contrib-sass
* grunt-autoprefixer
* grunt-contrib-cssmin

* grunt-contrib-watch
* grunt-contrib-connect
* connect-livereload

* browserify
* grunt-browserify
* deamdify
* debowerify
